We present you the Flyve MDM Plugin for GLPI

We integrated the outstanding features of Flyve MDM into GLPI platform providing you security functionalities for your IT infrastructure.

Flyve MDM secures all your devices, allowing you to manage your mobile fleet security policy with precision in order to protect sensitive company data stored on mobile devices.

As GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, we wanted to provide a plugin that helps you to keep control of your mobile devices through:

* [Fleet management](#fc)
* [Security Policies](#sp)
* [Deployment of applications and files](#ac)

Through the fleet configuration you will be able to manage the enrolled devices, applying the security policies and deploying the apps and files required.
